# Rubikstatistics

This application was created to visualize some data analysis based on statistics methods. 

You can visualize average, standard deviation, ... on a table or on a chart. 
I also implemented an exponential regression to give an estimation on the number of cube necessary to be under a certain time you can choose.
This method is an estimation but it is quite realistic. 
This application is more efficient if you have a lot of data to visualized.

Currently, the program accepte file that came from "Cube Timer" and only the 3x3x3 for "Twisty Timer".
I can add more application's file, leave me the file and the name of the application and I fixed it.

If you have any suggestions, you can leave a message to improve the application.
